Epidemiology unit functions under Ministry of Healthcare & Nutrition. It's main
responsibility is to strengthen surveillance of communicable diseases. This involves,
● Collecting incident reports
● Investigations
● Providing Statistics
● Pattern Recognition & forecasting
● Helping Law enforcement Process
However the current process around each of these activities involves several manual steps, which slow
down generating timely statistics & pattern recognition. With the spread of Dengue hemorrhagic fever & the Rubella vaccination programme to commence soon, the Epidemiology unit wants to stream line the
process of statistics collection & report generation.

The Unit wants to come up with a solution that would support on the spot incident reporting, eliminating the manual process in existence now. The collected statistics should also be available for report generation. The solution should focus on,
● Availability & Usability
● Security & integrity
● Scalability
